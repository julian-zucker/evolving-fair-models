\begin{abstract}

Machine learning practitioners must ensure that their models are fair, a difficult task in the face of many conflicting definitions of fairness. We present a multi-objective optimization technique for training classification models that allows practitioners to identify the tradeoff space between accuracy and fairness. We explore four different fairness metrics. After optimizing for false positive rate, false negative rate, and one fairness metric, we generate Pareto frontiers of possible models with varying accuracy/fairness tradeoffs. This Pareto frontier can be used by machine learning practitioners to identify how much accuracy must be sacrificed to achieve a specific level of fairness. After optimizing for false positive rate, false negative rate, and two fairness metrics, we look into the tradeoffs between different fairness metrics. Understanding which fairness metrics are contradictory to or synonymous with others reduces the number of metrics which must be examined to understand the overall fairness of a model. The cost to accuracy of different levels of each fairness metric is computed, and the cost of greatly increasing fairness is shown to be small.

\section{General Instructions}

This document
is a template which you can use to format your paper in 
preparation for publishing in the journal {\em Evolutionary Computation} 
(ECJ) and for submitting your paper to the journal. Our style file 
``ecj.sty'' is compatible with \LaTeX{} version 2e. Please note, also the 
first submission must be typeset using ECJ's \LaTeX{} style. {\em Documents 
typeset by MS Word or other office programs are not accepted.}   

Please make sure your paper is as complete and accurate as possible. You 
should typeset your paper as you would like to see it 
in its finally printed journal version (no double spacing; figures, tables 
should be embedded in the text at the most desirable locations). 

Please provide author(s) first initial and last name(s) for the even-page 
running headline. Also provide a brief paper title (45 characters/spaces or 
less) for the odd-page running headline.  See the ecjHeader section at the 
top of this document for placement of these items.

The rest of the document provides a few examples of references and 
citations, how to set up figures, discusses common problems, and provides some
general advice on writing your paper.

\begin{enumerate} 
    
\item
Give full names for authors.  (T. Bones should be Tom Bones or Thomas, 
unless your first name is a military secret and everyone calls you ``T''.)  

\item
Be sure to provide 5 to 10 keywords for your paper.  See ``keywords'' 
section above.

\item
Use the {\em Evolutionary Computation} format for references. In text 
citations should use the authors names (Smith, 1997) or ``Smith (1997) 
states ...''   The references at the back of the paper should also follow 
the {\em Evolutionary Computation} format. Using a bitex file, with
{\bf natbib.sty} and {\bf  apalike.bst}  is highly recommended. You
should then use 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt $\backslash$cite\{Smith\} states that \ldots} to obtain ``\cite{Smith} states that \ldots''
\item {\tt as stated in  $\backslash$citep\{Smith\}, \ldots} to obtain ``as stated in \citep{Smith} \ldots''
\end{itemize}

If you don't use natbib, be sure to follow the rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item 1 author: (Antonisse, 1989)
\item 2 authors: (Juliany and Vose, 1994)
\item multiple authors: (Reeves et al., 1990)
\item multiple citations: (Antonisse, 1989; Juliany and Vose, 1994) 
\end{itemize}


\item
If you use a bibtex file, please submit your bibtex file. In any case,
please completely 
spell out journal and institution titles.  Abbreviations may not be 
understood by all readers. Be sure to provide beginning {\em and} ending 
page numbers. Include editor(s) initials and last names(s), volume numbers, 
page ranges, publisher name and location.

See the Reference section of this paper for specific examples.

\end{enumerate}

\section{About Figures}

\newcommand{\fig}[2]{
	\begin{figure}[t]{
		\centering{
			\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{#1}
		}
		\caption{#2}
	}
	\end{figure}
}

\fig{FNR Ratio|German.png}{This is a caption below a framebox where a figure might appear.}

Figures potentially cause the most serious problems when processing \LaTeX{}
files. Image files should be in EPS (encapsulated postscript) or 
PNG format (both formats produce better outcome when enlarged). However, JPEG 
can be used as well. Make sure that no unusual files are required for 
processing your figures.
The use of the ``epsfig'' or the related ``graphicx'' \LaTeX{} package is 
strongly recommended as well as the
format found in ecjsample.tex used for generating Figure 1 above.
The use of the ``includegraphics'' command is commented out in the \LaTeX{} 
file;
but you can remove the ``comment'' symbols and use the
commands shown in ecjsample.tex.

Make sure you provide an in-text reference to each of your figures.  An 
example is Figure 1.

Make sure figures are clear and fit within the margins specified in the 
style file.  Small figures with hard to read labels or hard to see lines are 
a common problem.  Also make sure that labels and terms used in figures are
defined in either the caption or the text. (It is best if they
are defined in the caption.)

\section{Common Problems and Advice}

Avoid the use of too many acronyms. You may know the meaning and 
significance of BARF (e.g., Beer, Aspirin, Recreation, and Food), but this, 
in effect, amounts to the invention of a personal language that makes 
reading your paper more difficult.  Define each acronym on its first 
occurrence it the text; thereafter, you may use the acronym alone.

Avoid run-on sentences.  Typically these are very hard to parse. This is 
also one of the most common problems. While you are at it, use a spelling 
tool such as ispell.

Avoid paraphrases - ``i.e.'', ``e.g.'', ``in other words...'', or 
parenthetical information is often unnecessarily redundant.

Minimize the use of prepositions and adverbs to begin a sentence (``On the other hand...'', ``Conversely...'', ``Obviously...'').  Vary your sentence 
structure.

Avoid using excessive supporting information/documentation.  Select only the 
material that will strengthen your paper and is relevant and necessary.

For paper submission and the reviewing process, only the manuscript in 
PDF format is needed. After final acceptance, we will need all your files 
in electronic form.  This package should include at least the following 
files:  .tex, .bib, .bbl, .eps, .pdf, and any 
special style files you have used to create your paper.  We also need to be 
able to \LaTeX{} and generate camera-ready PDF of your paper. Following 
the examples given in ecjsample.tex will help ensure your \LaTeX{} file can be 
processed without error.

Thank you for submitting your work to {\em Evolutionary Computation}.
